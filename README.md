Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
Code: Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb

Goal: To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

Description: The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

Results: Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

Tech Store Sales Analysis
Goal: To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

Code: Tech Store Sales Analysis.ipynb

Description: The dataset contains a list of sales records. The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

Results: Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.

Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
Code: Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql

Description: The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.

Skills: DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

Technology: SQL Server

Covid 19 Data Exploration
Code: COVID Portfolio Project.sql

Description: The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

Skills: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

Technology: SQL Server

Legendary Pokémon Analysis
Goal: To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.

Code: Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)

Description: The dataset contains a list of Pokémon. The records include their characteristics such as attack, defense, type and size. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing characteristics of different Pokémon.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

Technology: Tidyverse
