# Mochamad Ridwan Rahmansyah - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
As a sixth-semester student majoring in Information Systems, my enthusiasm for information technology continues to drive my academic and professional endeavors. Building upon the foundation laid in previous semesters, I am further refining my IT Support skills while delving into advanced topics within this field.

In addition to my ongoing focus on hardware, software, and network support, I am expanding my knowledge in areas such as cybersecurity, cloud computing, data analytics, and emerging technologies. I am actively seeking hands-on experiences, internships, or projects that will allow me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and gain valuable experience.

As always, I remain committed to continuous learning and professional development. I regularly engage in self-study, participate in relevant workshops and seminars, and seek opportunities to collaborate with peers and industry professionals. My goal is to graduate as a well-rounded Information Systems professional equipped with both theoretical knowledge and practical expertise.

I am eager to explore internship opportunities or entry-level positions that will enable me to make meaningful contributions to an organization while furthering my growth and development in the field of information technology.

My portfolio serves as a repository to showcase my skills, share projects I have worked on, and track my progress in Data Analysis/Data Science-related topics.
