# Mochamad Ridwan Rahmansyah - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
As a sixth-semester student majoring in Information Systems, my enthusiasm for information technology continues to drive my academic and professional endeavors. Building upon the foundation laid in previous semesters, I am further refining my IT Support skills while delving into advanced topics within this field.

In addition to my ongoing focus on hardware, software, and network support, I am expanding my knowledge in areas such as cybersecurity, cloud computing, data analytics, and emerging technologies. I am actively seeking hands-on experiences, internships, or projects that will allow me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and gain valuable experience.

As always, I remain committed to continuous learning and professional development. I regularly engage in self-study, participate in relevant workshops and seminars, and seek opportunities to collaborate with peers and industry professionals. My goal is to graduate as a well-rounded Information Systems professional equipped with both theoretical knowledge and practical expertise.

I am eager to explore internship opportunities or entry-level positions that will enable me to make meaningful contributions to an organization while furthering my growth and development in the field of information technology.

My portfolio serves as a repository to showcase my skills, share projects I have worked on, and track my progress in Data Analysis/Data Science-related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### preprocess and prediction through ml models
**Code:** [`preprocess and prediction through ml models.ipynb`](https://github.com/mrrhmansyah/Portofolio-M-Ridwan-Rahmansyah/blob/main/preprocess%20and%20prediction%20through%20ml%20models.ipynb)

**Goal:** Preprocessing data is crucial in machine learning because it can help improve the quality of the built model and its prediction accuracy.

**Description:** This dataset contains information about the salaries of employees at a company. Each row represents a different employee, and the columns include information such as age, gender, education level, job title, years of experience, and salary.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.


### Cause Of Death Analysis

**Goal:** To analyze the causes of death in Indonesia since 2000

**Code:** [`Cause Of Death.ipynb`](https://github.com/mrrhmansyah/Portofolio-M-Ridwan-Rahmansyah/blob/main/Cause%20Of%20Death%20Analysis.ipynb)
